Hello World 🌎 - I would like to talk 🔈 about my self in this article. Let's start this journey together. My name is Stevenson and I'm an application web developer 🕸️.

The world of `World Wide Web` 🌐 had always fascinated me for a very long time. Ever since my only dream 🙃 was to architect real-time applications that millions of people use in real-time, for instance a 🚗 taxi booking app, a food delivery 🍔 app or some online 💵 payment app. I strongly believe the world of `Web Technology` is going to transform the world in the near future. Currently a lot of 🕸️ web apps that are built behave more like mobile 📱 app and show real-time data. In the near future the web is going to be a huge setup that will link most of the IoT devices together.

Currently I work with mostly `Javascript` tech stacks like `ReactJS` and `NodeJS`. I'm open to discussions on various Javascript technologies. I will try to update my blog as much as possible so that many of you can get an idea of the latest trends in technologies.
